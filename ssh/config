# SSH configuration

# Speed up new connections by reusing an already existing connection.
#
# ControlMaster auto tells your ssh client to always use a ControlMaster on all hosts.
# Or set it to autoask to have ssh prompt you for whether or not to reuse a connection.
#
# ControlPath tells ssh where it should keep its socket information.
# I've chosen to put these files in /tmp, however it may be best
# to put this into your own home directory on multi-user systems.
#
# To do ssh tunneling, you need to specify -o ControlMaster=no
# otherwise multiple tunnels to a particular host will not work.
